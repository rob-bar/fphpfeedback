###remarks

####1: Watch out with scafolding because it generates lot of unnescessairy code.
####2: Good use of the validation class!
####3: Try to group your controllers more
####4: Be cosistent in the use of if else statements in the views
	Its generally bad practice to use regular if else structure in your views
	see php files in repo
####5: Create one table to hold all your data, this is easier to export for someone who doesn't know the project
####6: Always save the language in your table, based on the language the user is watching
