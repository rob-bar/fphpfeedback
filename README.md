##SECOND EVALUATION
####1: Remove unnecessary files (e.g. Welcome controller)
####2: Use yml instead of php for multilang

I would like to mention that you both ignored some rules of the previous evaluation.
I would also recommend looking at this project as an example [Scansource](https://proximity-bbdo.beanstalkapp.com/scansource-activationplatform2012/browse/git)
